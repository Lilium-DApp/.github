### 🌟 Solution Description

Lilium DApp is a pioneering project dedicated to environmental conservation through the generation and trading of verified carbon credits. It seamlessly integrates two robust modules, ensuring the efficacy and security of carbon credit transactions:

1. **Auction DApp 🛒**: This module facilitates a revolutionary auction platform for fungible tokens, allowing users to list tokens for auction and prospective bidders to place their bids. The underlying algorithm optimizes the allocation of bids to maximize the seller's profits, ensuring a fair and secure auction environment.

2. **Verifier DApp 🔍**: This module employs the YOLOv8 algorithm and Scikit-learn with Gaussian Envelope to process images of trees and analyze environmental data. It assists in the quantification of forest biomass and the evaluation of the environmental quality of the monitored area, contributing to the generation of carbon credits.

### 🗝️ Key Features

**Auction System 🌐**: The Auction DApp module is designed to auction carbon credit tokens from producers with forest reserves, providing companies with a platform to bid on these tokens to offset their carbon emissions. The entire auction logic is embedded within the Cartesi Machine, ensuring unparalleled security and transparency in the auction process.

**AI-Powered Anomaly Detection 🤖**: The Verifier DApp module incorporates two AI models within a Cartesi Machine to ensure the accuracy and security of the generated tokens. The first model, utilizing TensorFlow, performs image detection to ensure optimal conservation of the area associated with carbon credit production. The second model, developed using the Sklearn Elliptic Envelope, identifies anomalies in humidity, temperature, and CO levels in the forest reserve, ensuring the integrity of the carbon credits generated.

**IoT System 📡**: An IoT system, consisting of temperature and humidity sensors, a volatile gas (CO) meter, and a camera, is deployed in forest reserve areas. The collected data is transmitted to the AI models, ensuring the consistent monitoring and verification of the environmental conditions of the area, further enhancing the reliability of the carbon credits generated.
