### Solution Description

Lilium is a project committed to environmental preservation, achieved through the implementation of a critical carbon credit auction system. Utilizing an innovative approach that integrates advanced technologies like Cartesi, Artificial Intelligence, and IoT, we are effectively addressing the fundamental challenges that the carbon credit market faces. Our primary mission is to enable carbon footprint offsetting, providing a comprehensive and impactful solution.

### Key features

**Auction system**: Auction system was developed with the purpose of making carbon credit tokens from producers with forest reserves available. In this way, companies generating a significant volume of CO2 emissions have the opportunity to bid on the auctioned tokens, aiming to offset their carbon footprint. The entirety of the auction logic has been incorporated into the Cartesi Machine, ensuring that the tokens are auctioned with the same security and transparency provided by blockchain technology, enhanced by the remarkable computational power of the Cartesi Machine.


**AI-powered Anomaly Detection**: In order to ensure greater accuracy and security of the generated tokens, two artificial intelligence models have been incorporated within a Cartesi Machine. The first of these models utilizes TensorFlow to perform image detection, thus ensuring that the area associated with carbon credit production is maintained in an optimally conserved state. On the other hand, the second model was developed using the Sklearn Elliptic Envelope, with the purpose of identifying anomalies in humidity, temperature, and CO levels in the forest reserve. To this end, the model underwent a training process based on satellite data, allowing it to understand the ideal patterns for the region under consideration.

**IoT system**: An IoT system has been designed for implementation in forest reserve areas. This device consists of temperature and humidity sensors, a volatile gas (CO) meter, and a camera. These pieces of information are collected and subsequently transmitted to the Artificial Intelligence models. In the event of detecting any inconsistencies in the data, tokens cannot be generated.
